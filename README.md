<!-- INTRO-START -->

### What does it do?

- Introduces Inputs associated with Sender and Outputs associated with Receivers
- Allows the configuration of media parameters of Senders and Inputs using information coming from Receivers and Outputs.

### Why does it matter?

- State of a Sender can be tuned to be compatible with a corresponding Receiver or many compatible Receivers

### How does it work?

- An endpoint on the side of Senders is introduced for media parameters control
- Senders and Receivers are followed with endpoints which list Inputs and Outputs respectively and describe them in detail
