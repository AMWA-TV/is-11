<!-- INTRO-START -->

### What does it do?

- Provides infomation about physical devices called Sinks associated with Receivers
- Allows to configure media parameters of Senders basing on information about Sinks

### Why does it matter?

- State of a Sender can be tuned it's configurable to be compatible with an according Receiver

### How does it work?

- An endpoint on the side of Senders is introduced for media parameters control
- Receivers are followed with endpoints which list Sinks and describe them in detail
