# API

The Sink Metadata Processing API provides a mechanism to change the settings associated with logical Sources, Flows and Senders. Another use case is obtaining information about Sinks associated with Receivers.

## Senders

`/senders/{senderId}/media-profiles` allows the client to pass an array of [Media Profiles](1.0.%20Overview.md#media-profile) to a Sender allowing the underlying component choose exactly which format to use at the moment and dictates that format changes which are not consequent to Media Profiles change MUST lay within Media Profiles set. A client can also pass a single Media Profile to specify the exact format.

The initial state of Media Profiles of any Sender is empty. Creating a connection with such a Sender via IS-05 doesn't involve the Sink Metadata Processing API.

A `GET` request returns the last successfully applied Media Profiles array.

A `PUT` request MUST be validated and if the Device supports the proposed media profile, it initiates an attempt to reconfigure the Device and update corresponding Flow, Source, and/or Sender properties. If successful, the operation MUST return the accepted Media Profiles array, otherwise an error MUST be returned and nothing changed.

A `DELETE` request MUST clear the last successfully applied Media Profiles array.

When the `media-profiles` structure changes as a consequence of PUT or DELETE (request is validated and accepted by the API server), then the associated IS-04 Sender MUST have its version updated (in registered mode this MUST update the registered resource).

If the new `media-profiles` structure causes underlying IS-04 flows and sources to change, then their version MUST be updated (in registered mode this MUST update the registered resources).

## Receivers

`/receivers/{receiverId}/sinks` returns a list of IDs corresponding to Sinks associated to the specific Receiver.

If the list of associated sinks changes then the underlying IS-04 receiver MUST update its version (in registered mode this MUST update the registered resource).

## Sinks

`/sinks/{sinkId}` provides the Sink resource which consists of the Resource Core and EDID parsed into JSON.

The API also allows a client to download the binary EDID using `/sinks/{sinkId}/edid` if it exists.

If the EDID information for the sink changes and it is associated with any receivers, then all of the receivers in question MUST update their version (in registered mode this MUST update the registered resources).
